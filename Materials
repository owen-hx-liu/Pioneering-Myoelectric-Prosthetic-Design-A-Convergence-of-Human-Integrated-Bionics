Hydrogels: These are water-based gels that can provide a soft and pliable texture, making them a good substitute for fatty tissue.

Silicone Gel: Often used in prosthetics for its soft and flexible properties, silicone gel can simulate the feel of fatty tissue.
Foam Padding: Different types of foam can be used to create a cushioned effect, similar to fatty tissue.
Elastomers: These are rubber-like materials that can mimic the elasticity and softness of fatty tissue. 

Combining different materials can provide the best of all worlds:
Outer Layer (Silicone): Provides durability and biocompatibility.
Inner Core (Hydrogel): Mimics the soft, compressible texture of natural fat.
Encapsulation Layer: Prevents the hydrogel from drying out or breaking down over time.
