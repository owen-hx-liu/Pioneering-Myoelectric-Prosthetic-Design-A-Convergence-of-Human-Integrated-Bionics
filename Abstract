Abstract:
Our project focuses on creating an improved myoelectric prosthetic that looks and functions more like a real limb. 
We are using a collagen fiber bone structure, Kevlar fiber cartilage, and synthetic skin to make it strong and flexible. 
Hydrogels and bio-scaffolds will help with tissue growth, while a thin carbon layer adds support. Metal sheets will connect to 
living tissue so electrical signals can pass through, allowing the prosthetic to move naturally. By designing the parts in CAD 
and studying how the materials work together, we hope to build a prosthetic that is more comfortable, durable, and lifelike for amputees.
