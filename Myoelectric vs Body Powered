Myoelectric vs Body-Powered https://journals.lww.com/jpojournal/Fulltext/2017/10001/Myoelectric_versus_Body_Powered_Upper_Limb.5.aspx 

Myoelectric Pros:
Provides both functional and cosmetic restoration
Eliminates the need for a harness, increasing comfort
More natural control using muscle signals
Greater grip strength with minimal effort
Reduces contralateral (opposite/non-dominant) arm overuse problems
Allows for easy interchangeability of terminal devices
Some models offer wrist rotation for better positioning

Myoelectric Cons:
Requires sufficient muscle activity for signal detection
No direct proprioceptive (body's ability to sense where its different parts are without needing to look) feedback, relies on visual/auditory cues
Susceptible to damage from water, dirt, and electronic interference
Requires battery power and regular charging
More expensive to purchase and maintain
Heavier than body-powered prostheses
Complex control at higher amputation levels

Body-Powered Pros:
Lightweight and mechanically simple
Lower cost and less maintenance required
Highly functional, especially body-powered hooks
Durable in harsh environments (wet, dirty, or corrosive conditions)
Provides proprioceptive feedback through cable/harness system
Body-Powered Cons:
Hooks are not cosmetic, often leading to rejection
Body-powered hands are inefficient and require high force to operate
Harness can be uncomfortable and cause pain or nerve impingement
Requires unnatural body movements for activation
Difficult to don and doff compared to myoelectric prostheses
Quick-disconnect wrists can be challenging to manage with one hand

Kevlar Hand Prosthetic

Researchers at the University of Michigan and Jiangnan University developed a synthetic cartilage made from Kevlar fibers and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).
This new material mimics natural cartilage, which is 80% water, by combining toughness and high water content.
Kevlar fibers provide strength, while PVA traps water, allowing the material to mimic cartilage's ability to deform and recover under stress.
The synthetic cartilage can withstand high pressure, similar to natural cartilage, and can be up to 92% water while maintaining strength.
This material could be used for joint replacements, particularly in the knee, and may allow chondrocytes (cartilage-producing cells) to grow within it.
Potential applications extend to other soft tissues, as the material could replicate properties needed for various membranes in the body.
