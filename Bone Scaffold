Living bone is a heterogeneous composite material consisting of mineral, collagen (type I), and water. 
Moreover, there are small quantities of other organic materials such as polysaccharides, proteins, proteoglycans, sialoproteins, and lipids in this dynamic/vascularized tissue.

Hydroxyapatite (HAp), which is the major component of bone mineral, is responsible for proper provision of structural support

Artificial bone remodeling is a process that uses synthetic materials to replace missing bone tissue and promote bone regeneration.
