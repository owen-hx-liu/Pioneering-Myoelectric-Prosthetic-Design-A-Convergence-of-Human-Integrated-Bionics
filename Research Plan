Research Plan:
Our research focuses on improving myoelectric prosthetics by exploring better materials for fat tissue, 
cartilage, and bone scaffolds. The goal is to create a prosthetic that is more durable, flexible, and lifelike.
We began by studying how current myoelectric prosthetics work and identifying their limitations. From there, we researched 
substitute materials that could better replicate human tissue, such as collagen-based bone structures, Kevlar fiber cartilage, 
and hydrogels for soft tissue. We will analyze how these materials interact and their ability to support electrical signal transmission. 
Our methodology includes material testing, CAD modeling, and structural analysis to ensure compatibility and function. 
A risk assessment will address potential material failures, bio-compatibility concerns, and safety during use. 
Through this research, we aim to develop a more effective and natural-feeling prosthetic limb.
